# Playwright E2E Demo Project ‚Äì Goodreads.com


This is a project that I created to demonstrate how I can build a robust end-to-end (E2E) test automation framework using Playwright on a real-world website: Goodreads.

It showcases:
- how test could be run sequentially and in parallel 
- how Page Object Model (POM) could be used 
- how to manage existing test data on testing environment
- how to use fixtures
- how to use storage state for authentication
- how to work with Setup and teardown for test data
- how to do CI integration with GitHub Actions
